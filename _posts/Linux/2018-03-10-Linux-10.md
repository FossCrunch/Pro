To generate the songs, DeepMusic uses “a collection of audio samples and a deep recurrent neural network,” as stated by Amazon on their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B6J18MP?ie=UTF8&path=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07B6J18MP&ref_=skillrw_dsk_si_dp&useRedirectOnSuccess=1&">official page.</a> This means that the new skill has access to some sample audio snippets of individual notes from instruments which it puts together following certain music algorithms.
<br><br>
Once the DeepMusic skill is enabled for Alexa, all you have to do is say “Alexa, ask DeepMusic to play a song,” “Alexa, tell DeepMusic to play audio,” or “Alexa, ask DeepMusic to start the music,” to hear an AI-generated song. When I tested it out, DeepMusic played a piano song called “We Shall Sail,” and while it technically stayed within traditional musical rules, it definitely had a robotic quality. This sounded like it was made by AI. It was stilted, certain notes would repeat mechanically, and sometimes, a stray note or chord would play that was brashly out of key.
<br><br>
Despite the limitations, it’s still pretty novel and reviewers on Amazon say they find the music relaxing and strangely familiar at times. DeepMusic isn’t generating anything Grammy-worthy, but the idea of having your virtual assistant play AI-created songs is intriguing all the same.
