<span class="first-letter">A</span>fter the Facebook data scandal, it has now come to notice that Twitter had also sold users' data to a Cambridge Analytica researcher who gathered the data of nearly 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge. 
<br>

According to the report, Twitter sold public data access in 2015 to Aleksandr Kogan, then a psychology researcher with University of Cambridge and his company Global Science Research (GSR). 
<br>

Twitter confirmed its relationship with DrKogan’s firm Global Science Research yesterday, revealing it allowed the firm to harvest “a random sample of public tweets for a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015”.
<br>

But, in a statement, the company claimed it was not the same sort of data breach that affected Facebook because the tweets had been knowingly shared publicly. 
<br>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">“Based on the recent reports, we conducted our own internal review and did not find any access to private data about people who use Twitter,”
</p>

</blockquote>

But Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used the Facebook data to influence elections, denied it had used Twitter information from Dr Kogan.
<br>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR or Aleksandr Kogan, and has never done any work with GSR on Twitter data. GSR was only ever a contractor to Cambridge Analytica and we understand it did work for many other companies.
</p>

</blockquote>

Regardless, Twitter will no longer allow Cambridge Analytica to book advertisements on its platform because it has “a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices,” though the company will still be allowed to use its Twitter account. 
<br>

Social-media companies have come under intense scrutiny over reports that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users. Companies like Twitter tend to have access to less private information than Facebook.
<br>

About 270,000 people downloaded Kogan's personality-quiz app, which shared information on the people and their friends that then was improperly passed to Cambridge Analytica.
<br>

Zuckerberg has testified in front of Congress about the misuse of data, and lawmakers have called on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google's India-born CEO Sundar Pichai to testify as well.
