A new Alexa skill has popped up called DeepMusic that enables you to listen to songs generated by artificial intelligence.To generate the songs, DeepMusic uses “a collection of audio samples and a deep recurrent neural network,” as stated by Amazon on their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B6J18MP?ie=UTF8&path=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07B6J18MP&ref_=skillrw_dsk_si_dp&useRedirectOnSuccess=1&">official page</a>. 
<br>

This means that the new skill has access to some sample audio snippets of individual notes from instruments which it puts together following certain music algorithms.
<br>

Once the DeepMusic skill is enabled for Alexa, all you have to do is say 
<br>

  <p class="mb-0"> “Alexa, ask DeepMusic to play a song,” “Alexa, tell DeepMusic to play audio,” or “Alexa, ask DeepMusic to start the music,” 
</p>
</blockquote>

When I tested it out, DeepMusic played a piano song called “We Shall Sail,” and while it technically stayed within traditional musical rules, it definitely had a robotic quality. This sounded like it was made by AI. It was stilted, certain notes would repeat mechanically, and sometimes, a stray note or chord would play that was brashly out of key.

Despite the limitations, it’s still pretty novel and reviewers on Amazon say they find the music relaxing and strangely familiar at times. DeepMusic isn’t generating anything Grammy-worthy, but the idea of having your virtual assistant play AI-created songs is intriguing all the same
