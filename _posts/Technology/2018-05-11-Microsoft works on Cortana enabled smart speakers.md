<p>In<strong> CES 2018</strong>, Qualcomm has confirmed that its Smart Audio platform will now support Cortana.</p>
<p>The Smart speaker is expected to be powered by <strong>Snapdragon 212</strong> which is specialized for Internet Of Things(IoT) . It is based on ARM Cortex-A7 architecture and its a Quad core processor with clock speed of <strong>1.3 gigahertz. </strong>Well, it's pretty good choice for a powerful smart speaker.</p>
<p>Snapdragon 212 was originally designed to work in smartphone's but due to its efficiency and versatility it popular among the <strong>IOT devices.</strong></p>
<p>It is likely that Microsoft is partnered with Taiwanese contract manufacturer<strong> Quanta Computer,</strong> the design for the smart speaker has been recently completed by the reference board, it has to undergo series of development stages.</p>
