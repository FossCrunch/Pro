Mark Zuckerberg just announced that Facebook is joining the dating game, to help users build perhaps "the most meaningful relationship of all.", Kicking off the company’s annual F8 developer conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said there are<strong> 200 million</strong> users on Facebook who list their relationship status as<strong>“single." </strong>
<br>

The new <strong>Tinder-killer</strong> will live inside the app, and Zuckerberg said that it won’t be visible to friends or family, and won’t pair you with your existing friends. News of Facebook’s new feature caused the stock of Tinder-owner Match Group to quickly droop. The other big news of F8 Day 2: Zuckerberg announced that, for the first time, Facebook users can opt out of the company’s data gathering practices, which it uses to sell targeted ads.

The CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his executive team generally unveil what the company has been working on for the last year. It turns out one of those things is a competitor for apps like Tinder and Hinge, although he emphasized the intent to build<strong> long term relationships, and "not just hookups."</strong>
<br>

The Facebook dating feature will be integrated into the main mobile app, but wannabe dates would be able to create dating profiles which will be separate from their Facebook profile.
<br>

It’s unclear how developers could control that aspect of the features, but the CEO acknowledged potential security concerns, saying: 

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">“I want to be clear that we have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning.”
</p>

</blockquote>

Facebook's chief product officer, <strong>Chris Cox</strong>, said that the idea stemmed from couples who had told Zuckerberg that meeting their partner was the most important thing that had happened to them on Facebook. 
<br>

The goal, he said, was to make a product that would let more couples do the same “in a way that was opt-in, in a way that was safe, and in a way that took advantage of the unique properties of the platform and didn’t get in the way of everyone who wasn’t interested in dating”.
<br>

Facebook will use a <strong>unique algorithm</strong> to match you with potential dates, based on “dating preferences, things in common, and mutual friends.” You will also be able to find romantic interests via shared Groups and Events.
<br>

Lets wait and see the impact of Facebook's dating feature over the days to come.
