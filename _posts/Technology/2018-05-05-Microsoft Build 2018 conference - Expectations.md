<span class="first-letter">M</span>icrosoft Build is starting in just a few days, and with it we’ll see what Microsoft has in store for us in the coming year. The annual event, like <strong>Google I/O</strong> (which starts just one day later), is a celebration of the company's developer community. That means you can expect plenty of technical details and on-stage coding during the two keynotes, which will be led by Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> and operating systems head <strong>Joe Belfiore.</strong>
<br>

Some of the major updates we’re expecting to see at Microsoft Build 2018 teases of <strong>Redstone 5</strong> (the codename for the next major Windows 10 update), Windows Mixed Reality updates and some AI news. It’s unlikely that Microsoft will announce anything beyond software, so you shouldn’t be expecting the next Surface devices here.
<br>

<h3><b>How to watch</b></h3>
If you cannot travel to Seattle to attend the event in-person, you can fortunately watch the keynotes for free right <strong><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/build2018/">here</a></strong> from the comfort of your home. You’ll be able to catch them live on May 7 and 8 with sessions starting around 4.30pm UK time, which is 8.30am local time (Seattle).
<br>

Ok, Now lets dive in, What we could expect in Microsoft Build 2018.
<br>

<h3><b>Artifical Intelligence</b></h3>

AI is one of the biggest things in the tech industry in 2018, and Microsoft has already made huge steps to capitalize on it – and you can be sure it’ll be a huge focus at Microsoft Build 2018. 
<br>

we expect to hear a lot more about <strong>Windows ML</strong>, the machine-learning platform that arrived alongside last month's Windows 10 update. Windows Machine Learning (Windows ML) is an API allows developers to incorporate machine learning models into their apps. And, because WinML is a relatively recent technology, we’re expecting Microsoft to go into a lot of detail about it. 
<br>

Microsoft has made huge strides in bringing artificial intelligence to its consumer products recently. Its <strong>Cortana</strong> virtual assistant is steadily getting smarter (it's certainly more useful on a desktop than Siri). we expect a lot of sessions to focus around AI, its capabilities and maybe some new features.
<br>

<h3><b>Windows Mixed Reality</b></h3>

After launching Windows <strong>Mixed Reality </strong>last fall, alongside a slew of headsets from PC makers like HP, Acer and Samsung, Microsoft has been surprisingly quiet about the state of its VR and AR platform. The fact that many headsets have gotten drastically cheaper in just a few months. 
<br>

We’re not sure exactly what Microsoft has planned for Mixed Reality in Redstone 5 and beyond, but we’re expecting to at least see a continuation of their recent efforts to improve performance and ease-of-use.
<br>

<h3><b>Azure Cloud</b></h3>

Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing service, has always been a big piece of the Build conferences and we see no reason for the trend to stop now and one thing is clear, Its cloud business is booming. So don't be surprised if the company spends a large chunk of time at Build talking about how it can make Azure better for developers. But for brands and businesses, it's yet another way to ensure their apps and online services are stable, secure and can withstand a potential onslaught of demand.
<br>

<h3><b>IoT devices</b></h3>

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the new buzzing word in the tech world, and Microsoft might not want to be left behind. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that they’ll spend a <strong>$5 billion</strong> on IoT over the next four years. Microsoft trying to implement its Cortana virtual assistant into more devices – perhaps even announcing some new hardware partnerships.
<br>

Thanks to the Cortana Skills Kit, Cortana is more capable than ever before – and even cares if you live or die. So, we should see Cortana improve over time, it has a huge install base, after all – it’s a potential goldmine. At Build, the company is expected to talk about what new IoT-related stuff they have developed.
