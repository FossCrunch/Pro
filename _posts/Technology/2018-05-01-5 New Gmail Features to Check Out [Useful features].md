Gmail is getting its <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/360579/google-is-giving-gmail-a-makeover">first major desktop redesign</a> in years. Rolling out for all personal Gmail users and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/352023/google-g-suite">G Suite</a> early adopter program (EAP) customers, the revamped email service sports a streamlined interface, plus a bevy of new intelligence and security features geared toward productivity. 
<br>

Google says it's rolling out the updated Gmail in phases, so it could be a little bit before you're treated to Gmail's new look and enhanced capabilities. You can speed things along, though, by trying to <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-get-new-gmail,news-27061.html">get the revamped Gmail now</a>. Just click on Settings — that's the Gear icon in the right corner of your inbox — and select Try the New Gmail if that option is available. If you don't like what you see, you can use the Settings to go back to the classic Gmail look.
<br>

Below, check out the most important changes and additions.
<br>

<h3><b>1. Confidential Mode</b></h3>
Confidential mode is the biggest new Gmail feature. When composing a new message, you can click the lock/clock icon on the option bar to enter confidential mode.<br><br>
This gives you a far more granular degree of control over who can see the information in an email and what they can do with it. Confidential mode lets you set an expiration date on the email, anything from a day to a week or more. After that, it disappears and the recipient sees an "email has expired" message instead.<br><br>
Senders can also limit recipient privileges, like the ability to forward the confidential email or download attachments, and if a message is locked it needs to be authenticated either by directly granting access or using additional <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358289/two-factor-authentication-who-has-it-and-how-to-set-it-up">two-factor authentication.</a>
<br>

<h3><b>2. Snooze Messages</b></h3>
At least several times a day, usually during working hours, an important message will pop up in Gmail that requires more of a thoughtful response than I can give it at the moment. My options are either to drop what I'm doing and respond or ignore the message and hope I remember to get to it later. Gmail's new Snooze feature is a better approach to that latter problem.<br><br>
Select the Snooze option, and Gmail makes a message go away, only to bring it back to your attention at a later point in time. By default, you can make message vanish until later today, tomorrow, this weekend, next week or the disturbingly vague "Someday." You also have the option of setting a specific time for that snoozed message to return to your attention.
<br>

<h3><b>3. Unsend a message</b></h3> 
You can take back access to emails sent in confidential mode anytime before they are set to expire. Go into your sent folder, find the message, and click "remove access." If you change your mind or if it expired too soon, click "renew access." <br><br>
Note: The recipient will still see that you sent them an email, including the subject line, but if they try to click it, they'll be told "You don't have access to this email." 
<br>

<h3><b>4. Nudging</b></h3>
Nudging is another new smart feature along these same lines. As part of building in proactive AI tools into the experience, Google now helps you manage your inbox by suggesting or "nudging" you to respond to an email that's been sitting in your inbox for a few days. The bold text is designed to catch your eye to give you a chance to respond to or clear an email you would've otherwise glazed over.
<br>

<h3><b>5. Smart Reply</b></h3>
If you use the mobile version of Gmail, you're already familiar with the Smart Reply feature that puts tappable canned responses in a message to help you quickly reply. That feature's made its way to Gmail on the desktop, saving you from unnecessary keystrokes when all you need to do is confirm that a meeting time is good for you.
