<p><span class="first-letter">G</span>oogle announced it's major <a href="https://fosscrunch.com/new-gmail-features/" target="_blank">updates</a> to Gmail during the Google I/O 2018 conference. One of the most crucial updates is <strong>"Gmail offline mode"</strong> replacing the Gmail offline Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-offline/ejidjjhkpiempkbhmpbfngldlkglhimk" target="_blank">app</a> that was previously used to achieve the same. Though it was an awkwardly stripped-down mobile-like interface in place of the regular Gmail environment.</p>
<p>What's special about offline mode is that you can search your inbox, read messages, even compose email as you do in the regular Gmail. Your composed emails will be queued up in the <strong>Outbox</strong>. Once you reconnect with the internet, The mail will be sent and new mail will be downloaded. This will be handy for desktop users with <strong>limited</strong> connectivity.</p>
<p>I will walk you to the steps to be followed but make sure to try out this in your personal computer, not in <strong>public</strong> or <strong>shared</strong> <strong>computer</strong>.</p>
<p>Wait, But initially, to enable the feature you must have a proper internet connection.</p>
<h3><strong>How to enable offline mode?</strong></h3>
<p>To enable Offline mode you should login to your Gmail account, Remember for now <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a> is the only supported web browser.</p>
<ol>
<li>In your, Gmail click the <strong>Settings/Gear Icon</strong> on the top right corner</li>

<li>Select <strong>"Try the new Gmail"</strong></li>

<li>Once it's enabled, Again click <strong>Settings/Gear Icon</strong></li>

<li>Then click <strong>S</strong><strong><strong>ettings</strong></strong> switch to <strong>offline</strong> tab</li>

<li>And then tick the &ldquo;<strong>E</strong><strong><strong>nable</strong></strong> <strong>offline mail&rdquo;</strong> box</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have enabled offline mode, now you can adjust the preferences. Like <strong>sync duration</strong> (e.g. storing emails for seven days, 30 days or 90 days), and choose whether to download attachments when syncing and if you're using public or shared computer you can delete your <strong>offline</strong> <strong>data</strong> from the browser while you log out. This can be done by ticking the box labeled <strong>&ldquo;Remove offline data from my computer&rdquo;</strong> and finally <b>save</b> the settings</p>
