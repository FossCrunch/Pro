YouTube is the internet’s replacement for the TV, thus it’s entirely natural that we’d utilize it as our background noise provider, however Google doesn’t make that easy on mobile devices. Unless you receive a YouTube Red subscription, YouTube only plays as a foreground app, meaning you can’t use your telephone and listen to music or podcasts on YouTube at the same time. Well, unless you rip off a small. 
<br>

The Android version of the Telegram messaging app can play YouTube video links directly, without asking to send you away to another app. This is altogether fine and formal, but the fun begins when you minimize Telegram or even turn the screen off entirely.
<br>

The audio from the YouTube content keeps playing. With this little trick, I can just message myself anything I want to listen to (rather than watch) and leave it playing while I do other things with my phone. 
<br>

Some phones like Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 and LG’s V30 offer split-screen multitasking that will let you have a YouTube window alongside some other activity, but that’s obviously nowhere near as elegant as actually working in the background. As it turns out, people have already been quite industrious in figuring out alternative tactics. 
<br>

On the iPhone (where the same Telegram trick doesn’t work), you can use a third-party browser such as Dolphin to start a YouTube video, then exit the app and resume playback via the iOS Control Center. 
<br>

Dead simple. Almost the same thing exists for Android users with Google’s own Chrome browser. If you switch to the desktop (rather than mobile) YouTube site in Chrome, you’ll be able to start a video in the browser, then exit the app and resume playback from the notification shade.
<br>

This is by far the slickest of all options: you can play or pause either from notifications or from the phone’s lock screen. Even better: there’s nothing stopping you from opening further tabs in Chrome and continuing to use the browser as usual.

<h3><b>How to run YouTube in the background on Android and iOS? (No App Required)</b></h3>
You can take advantage of a workaround to play YouTube videos in the background if you use Google Chrome. It might not be as convenient as Red, but the trick does the job by taking advantage of Chrome’s desktop mode feature.
<br>
<ol>
		<li>1. Open <a href="https://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> in the Chrome browser.</li>
		<li>2. In the three-dot menu at the top right, check the “Request desktop site” box.</li>
		<li>3. Navigate to the video you want to listen to and press play.</li>
	  <li>4. If you’re shown a warning saying YouTube wants to send you notifications, accept it.</li>
		<li>5. Exit the Chrome app and you’ll be able to resume playback from the notification menu.</li>
</ol> 
<h3><b>And on iOS:</b></h3>
<ol>
	<li>1. Download the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dolphin-web-browser/id452204407?mt=8">Dolphin web browser</a> to your iOS device.</li>
	<li>2. Open <a href="https://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> in Dolphin.</li>
	<li>3. Navigate to the video you want to listen to and press play.</li>
	<li>4. Exit the Dolphin app and you’ll be able to resume playback from the iOS Control Center</li>
</ol>  
You can also use any other browser to run YouTube in the background, provided it has the desktop mode option available. However, playback controls in the Notifications shade and on the lock screen may differ.
