<p><span class="first-letter">F</span>acebook&rsquo;s <strong>data scandal</strong> has drawn everyone&rsquo;s towards the vulnerability of the social media platform. Personal information of more than <strong>50 million</strong> users has been misused by <a href="https://cambridgeanalytica.org/" target="_blank">Cambridge analytica</a> for <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Donald Trump</a> in the <strong>2016 United States</strong> election.</p>
<p>After that scandal many users scared about their data being used over, some even deleted their account. So don&rsquo;t worry here are some tips to safeguard your personal information from Facebook. You can <strong>safeguard</strong> by limiting your personal data from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-third-party-app-4154068">Third party applications</a>. By default, Facebook enables our personal information to flow with all third-party application and games. Follow the below three steps to limit your personal data being shared.</p>
<h3><strong>Step One: Turn off platform</strong></h3>
<p>Open the Settings menu by clicking the down <strong>arrow button</strong>, which is located on the top bar of your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook homepage</a>, select &lsquo;<strong>Apps</strong>&rsquo;. Under &lsquo;<strong>Apps, </strong>Websites<strong> and Plug-ins</strong>&rsquo; section select on the &lsquo;<strong>Edit</strong>&rsquo; button. This is default enabled feature which allows you to use &ldquo;apps, plug-ins, games, and websites on Facebook and elsewhere&rdquo;.</p>

</center>   
</div>
<center>
<footer class="imgcc">
    <p>Facebook - Disable Platform settings</p>
</footer>
</center>
<p>This will revoke access to third-party sources from using your Facebook information for logins.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Two: Uncheck from &ldquo;Apps others use&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>From the same window instead of selecting &ldquo;Apps, Websites and Plug-ins&rdquo;, Select &ldquo;<strong>Apps others use</strong>&rdquo;, tab.</p>
<div class="article-main-img">
<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/main/2018-06-02-Facebook-minimize-personal-data-02.jpg" alt="{{page.tags | join: ', '}}">
</center>
</div>
<center>
<footer class="imgcc">
    <p>Uncheck the information not to be shared </p>
</footer>
</center>
<p>Here you can <strong>uncheck all</strong> the data which you don&rsquo;t want the third party application to access. You can uncheck each and every box to restrict all the data being used by the third-party application.</p>
<h3><strong>Step Three: Turn off Location</strong></h3>
<p>The most <strong>sensitive data</strong> required for the third party application will be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location" target="_blank">location</a> services, which let the application information about where are you from, where are you going, your<strong> travel history</strong> will be shared. Thereby categorizing you to according to your <strong>frequent visit</strong> to a shop, hotel and anywhere.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t disable your entire location service, because <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google&rsquo;s location</a> services may be used to find your device, your interested places and many more. Better you turn off location data being accessed by some unwanted third-party application. For <strong>Android users</strong> tap on &gt;"account settings" then tap on &gt;"Location" and toggle the access on to off.</p>

<footer class="imgcc">
    <p>Turn off location in iOS</p>
</footer>
</center>

<p>For <strong>iOS</strong> users get into the <strong>general tab</strong> in settings and head on to location services in privacy tab. select Facebook from the list of application. It&rsquo;s better to select "<strong>Never</strong>" off service since there is no need for Facebook to collect location data unless you wish to.</p>
