<p><span class="first-letter">A</span>rtificial intelligence is implemented to solve almost every problem. The medical industry is no different, The study of Cell biology has its deeper root in medical. Already biologists have developed a huge library of the cell structures and their corresponding data. But the microscopes have certain limitations, that stands as a bottleneck for the scientists to explore the tiny cell and their functionalities more deeper.</p>
<p>The thirst for exploring the more precise structure and functionality of cell has driven the researchers of Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle to use Artificial intelligence to design the first predictive model of the human cell called "<strong>The Allen Integrated Cell</strong>", this could be completely a revolutionary in the medical industry. This will let the scientists see the interior of the human cell.</p>

<p>This achievement will have a great impact in <strong>drug discovery, disease research</strong> and will be helpful in understanding the basics of the human cell. Probably this could also solve the mysteries behind <strong>Cancer.</strong></p>
<p>To create the <strong>3D</strong> model of the cell the scientist's gene edited the large collection of live human cell's to incorporate <strong>fluorescent</strong> protein tags, that will illuminate the specific structures inside the cells.</p>

<p>The team captured thousands of images of these cells and used <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> to create the AI model that predicts the location of structures and shape in any cell based on the shape of the nucleus and the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>The Research team applied machine learning algorithm to the images, it eventually applied what it learned from cells with fluorescent labels to find cellular structures in cells without fluorescent labels. With all these data the system managed to create the images of cells the look nearly identical.</p>
<p>Currently, scientists use the traditional method such as <strong>fluorescence microscopy</strong>, which is absolutely expensive and toxic. The Allen Integrated Cell is ultimate because it opens a new way of doing cell biology. Let us look forward to more such discoveries. Stay tuned with us.</p>
