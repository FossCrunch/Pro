<span class="first-letter">H</span>ave you ever thought, why plane windows are round? but not square. Probably most people think, circle or oval always looks better than square, What if earth square? horrible. Believe, there's is a <strong>scientific reason</strong> behind this.</p>
<p>Till 1950 the window was square since it's also easy for manufacturing may be the one who designed prefers square shape. The design was changed after this unnoticeable design made a tragic crash for the commercial jetliner, the de Havilland <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet">Comet</a> taking away like of more than 50 people.</p>
<p>In short note, the reason is the sharp edges of the square window. Obviously square will have <strong>sharp edges</strong> which becomes the<strong> week spot</strong>. Now you figure out the reason that round windows will not have edges with any weak spot.</p><div class="article-main-img artimg2">

</div><p>When the airplane climbs up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> decreases, in order to maintain atmospheric pressure an internal pressure is created inside. As the height increases at a point, internal pressure exceeds the external pressure which causes the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage"> fuselage</a> to expand slightly, creating stress all over the body. The weakest part in fuselage probably is the window. Hence circle shaped window which has no weak spot can manage it well.</p>
<p>Not to worry about canceling your upcoming flight trip.<strong> Designers</strong> made a nice round design after that incident, which can manage the <strong>pressure</strong> to ensure our safety. Have this talk to your neighbor in the plane, about the reason for rounded window and have a nice scare-free journey!!!</p>
