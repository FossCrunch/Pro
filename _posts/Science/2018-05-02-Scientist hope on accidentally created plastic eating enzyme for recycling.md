Scientists have engineered an enzyme which can digest polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the plastic used in single-use plastic bottles and other common packaging. 
<br>

This could revolutionize the recycling process, allowing plastics to be re-used more effectively.UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled. 
<br>

"[PET] has only been around in vast quantities over the last 50 years, so it's actually not a very long timescale for a bacteria to have evolved to eat something so man-made," commented Prof John McGeehan, who was involved in the current study.
<br>

More than eight million tons of plastic are dumped into the world's oceans every year, and concern is mounting over this petroleum-derived product's toxic legacy on human health and the environment. 
<br>

Despite recycling efforts, most plastic can persist for hundreds of years in the environment, so researchers are searching for better ways to eliminate it.
<br>

<h3><b>Hungry enzyme</b></h3> 


The new research sprang from the discovery of bacteria in a Japanese waste recycling center that had evolved the ability to feed on plastic. The bugs used a natural enzyme called PETase to digest PET bottles and containers.
<br>

While analyzing the molecular structure of PETase, scientists at the University of Portsmouth accidentally created a powerful new version of the protein. Working with the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the scientists subjected PETase to intense X-ray beams at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Harwell, Oxfordshire.
<br>

A high definition 3D model of the enzyme was created, using the powerful x-ray beamline at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. Once they understood its structure, the team noted that they could improve the performance of PETase by adjusting a few residues on its surface.
<br>

The result was a mutant protein with an enhanced ability to attack plastic. It could also attack another form of plastic, polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF), a bio-based substitute for PET plastics that is being hailed as a replacement for glass beer bottles.

<h3><b>Analysis -by David Shukman, Science Editor</b></h3> 
The team behind the research at Portsmouth University includes PhD students and even undergraduates, and when I visited their lab their excitement was infectious. 
<br>

They know that it took clever chemistry to design the PET polymer used in so many billions of bottles and they are delighted to have helped find a way to unpick it. They have grown up with the scourge of plastic pollution and feel highly motivated about trying to tackle it. 
<br>

Yet big challenges lie ahead in turning an ingenious discovery into a real-world application. Developing a technique for producing the enzyme cheaply will be one key hurdle; another will be to harness its power on an industrial scale.
<br>

But this is an example of accelerated science. A type of bacteria evolved to live off plastic in the last few decades. The enzyme it uses to digest PET was only recently identified. 
<br>

Now we have details of the newly engineered and more efficient version of that enzyme. In the search for scientific solutions to the plastic pollution crisis, momentum like this is vital.
<br>

<h3><b>Early potential</b></h3> 
Independent scientists not directly involved with the research said it was exciting, but they cautioned that the enzyme’s development as a potential solution for pollution was still at an early stage.

“There is strong potential to use enzyme technology to help with society’s growing waste problem by breaking down some of the most commonly used plastics.” 
<br>

Researchers say they are now working on further improvements to the enzyme, with the hope of eventually scaling it up for industrial use in breaking down plastics.

"Although the improvement is modest, this unanticipated discovery suggests that there is room to further improve these enzymes, moving us closer to a recycling "solution for the ever-growing mountain of discarded plastics."
