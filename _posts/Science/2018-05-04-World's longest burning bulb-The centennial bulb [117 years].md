<p><span class="first-letter">E</span>ver <strong>wonder</strong>, how long the world's longest bulb been burning? The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centennialbulb.org/" target="_blank">Centennial bulb</a> celebrating its <strong>117th anniversary</strong> (as of June 2018).Burning since 1901, it&rsquo;s located at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livermore,_California" target="_blank">Livermore, California</a>. The bulb is placed inside the <strong>fire station</strong> maintained by the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department. In fact centennial bulb probably <strong>world's first light</strong> to have its own website, live webcam feed, Facebook and annual birthday celebration. The bulb has been officially recognized by The <strong>Guinness Book</strong> of <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-burning-light-bulb/" target="_blank">World Records</a>, Believe It or Not! , and General Electric as the world&rsquo;s longest-burning light bulb.</p>

<h3><b>But How it works?</b></h3>
<p>The 116-year-old bulb was burning for most of its existence but<strong> how?</strong> There are few theories for this, like the slight variation from the design of Edison&rsquo;s bulb which accounts for <strong>longevity</strong>. Another fact is being turned off rarely- the filament inside the bulb will be cooled and reheated every time when it&rsquo;s turned on and off. This <strong>stresses the metal filament</strong> and also creates a tiny crack. Hence switching <strong>it on and off</strong> the crack grows causing the filament breaks and light escapes.</p>
<h3><b>Hard to find this &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo;</b></h3>
<p>In its <strong>illustrious life</strong>, due to human error or intervention, the centennial bulb has been &ldquo;off&rdquo; for several occasion. First, it happened when it was moved to a new station in <strong>1903</strong>, it was off for about a week. &ldquo;Mystery&rdquo;-The longest intervention happened on May 20th, 2013 when the ups failed and it was off for more than 9 hours after which when turned on it glowed with <strong>60 watts</strong> for few hours and dimmed to its former 4 hours. Earlier days the local has no power back up it would have been subjected to local power outage since it is connected to local power grid.</p>
<h3><b>Is it Planned obsolescence</b></h3>
<p>Wikipedia states it a <strong>planning or designing a product</strong> with artificially limited use in order to increase the sales repeatability which causes it to <strong>obsolete</strong> (that is no longer functional) after a certain period of time. The centennial bulb has been oft-cited a textbook reference for the planned obsolescence.</p>

<h3><b>Manufacturer's cartel</b></h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/02/03/tests-shine-light-on-the-secret-of-the-livermore-light-bulb/" target="_blank">Review</a> add that, Thomas Edison&rsquo;s<strong> commercial bulb lasts for 1500 hours</strong> in 1881. But in 1924 secret cartel formed by America and Europe bulb manufacturer&rsquo;s reduced the bulb average life below <strong>1000 hours</strong> and this become standard by 1940&rsquo;s. Eventually, the general electric and other bulb manufacturer&rsquo;s where banned from limiting the bulb life when the cartel exposed</p>
<p>For <strong>every 30 seconds</strong>, a photo will be taken by the webcam which keeps an eye on the bulb for 24/7 and the photo is uploaded to <a href=" http://www.centennialbulb.org/cam.htm" target="_blank">centennialbulb wedsite</a>.</p>
