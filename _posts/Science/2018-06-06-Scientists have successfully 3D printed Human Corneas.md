<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>cientists at <strong>Newcastle University</strong> have successfully 3D printed the part of the human eye called <strong>Cornea</strong>. It is the thin protective film through which the light passes before reaching <strong>Retina</strong> in the internal part of the eye.<br /><br />Any damage to Cornea from injury or infection causes distorted vision, or even lead to <strong>blindness</strong>. Currently, the damaged Corneas are replaced with the healthy one from the deceased <strong>donors</strong> but there aren&rsquo;t enough donated corneas to go around. <br /><br />This 3D printed Cornea is the most advanced version of its kind, this could eventually help millions of people to see again. According to World Health Organisation, there are nearly <strong>5 million</strong> people blind due to the infection that affected cornea.</p>
<h3><strong>The Bio-ink for printing</strong></h3>

<p>The bio-ink used for printing the cornea need to thin and also stiff enough to hold its shape as <strong>3D structure</strong>. To get the right consistency, the researchers added <strong>alginate</strong> which is a jelly-like substance and <strong>stem cells</strong> extracted from donor corneas, along with some proteins called <strong>collagen</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>How did scientists do that?</strong></h3>
<p>Initially, the scientists figured out the shape of the human cornea by <strong>imaging</strong> the volunteers eyeball with a special camera and created the 3D model with the help of the image.</p>
<p>Then, the team fed that template to a 3D printer, which squirted the bio-ink into a supportive bed of Jello to create the cornea. The result produced a <strong>soft contact lens </strong>like substance.</p>
<p>However this technique doesn't completely eliminate the need for cornea donation- those are the key part of producing the stem cell. Anyhow instead of replacing one damaged cornea with one healthy cornea, you could grow <strong>50</strong> artificial ones from <strong>a single</strong> donor.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a long way to go before these artificial corneas will even get close to a human eyeball:&nbsp; According to Connon they have to fine tune the printing process and the artificial cornea will also need to go through safety studies in <strong>animals</strong>. But this study is proof that you can 3D print something that looks like a cornea and contains mostly the same ingredients. It&rsquo;s also the first time researchers have recreated the cornea&rsquo;s distinctive, curved shape.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">“Connon says that&rsquo;s key for the artificial cornea to work: &ldquo;Without the shape, you don&rsquo;t have a cornea &mdash; you have something else.&rdquo;"

<p>It's happy that Technology evolution has made a great effort to fight blindness.</p>
