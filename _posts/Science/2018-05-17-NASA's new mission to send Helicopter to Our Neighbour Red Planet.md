description: Wright brothers proves that controlled flight is possilobe in the planet earth, now NASA plans to prove it again but in the red planet " The Mars ", NASA is sending a helicopter to Mars along with Mars 2020 Rover.

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/mars-helicopter-to-fly-on-nasa-s-next-red-planet-rover-mission" target="_blank">NASA</a> plans to send an <strong>unmanned tiny helicopter</strong> to explore more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" target="_blank">MARS</a>. Us space agency announced it on Friday about the unmanned air trip in the <strong>red planet</strong> along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_2020" target="_blank">Mars 2020 Rover</a>.</p>
<p>The four pounds(1.8 kilograms) aircraft simply known as "<strong>The Mars Helicopter</strong>" having its main fuselage or body section to the size of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball" target="_blank">softball</a>. From the video published by NASA jet propulsion laboratory, the helicopter</p>

<p>The mars helicopter will be model for the future Mars mission, capable of accessing the place which rover cant reach. The airtime plans are being laid for 30 days including five flights going incrementally further each time.</p>
<p>The helicopter consists of <strong>two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra-rotating_propellers" target="_blank">coaxial propellers</a></strong> to fly through the thin skies of Mars, rotating at the <strong>RPM of 3000</strong> which is much less when compared to earth.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about <strong>40,000 feet</strong> (12,200 meters). The atmosphere of Mars is only one percent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_surface" target="_blank">Martian surface</a>, it's already at the Earth equivalent of <strong>100,000 feet </strong>(30,480 meters) up,”

<p>The mars helicopter is equipped with <strong>Lithium-ion batteries </strong>which will be charged by <strong>solar cells</strong>, included a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.</p>

<p>They have designed the <strong>space helicopter super light</strong>, so it can easily fly through the thin helicopter, and controllers were also designed to get a command from the rover it's hard to the controller it with a joystick from earth.</p>

<p>This is another <strong>milestone</strong> of NASA and let us wait and watch NASA making a history of this <strong>era</strong>!!!</p>
