<p><span class="first-letter">B</span>allpoint pen is one of the most common things that we use in our day-to-day life, but many people have never paid attention to the <strong>hole</strong> at the end of the ballpoint pens. Some might have thought it as a common <strong>design feature.</strong></p>
<p>Widely accepted myth for the hole is, it helps in preventing the ink from<strong> drying</strong> on the nibs. So that it will be easy to maintain the ink flow every time when it is used. But that's among the <strong>conspiracy</strong> theory.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific</strong> people have their own theory for the cap hole, according to science, it helps in equalizing the <strong>air pressure</strong>, making it easier to open and close the cap. Probably this is one of the real facts. Thought the actual reason is bit different.</p>
<p>People have the habit of <strong>chewing</strong> pen caps especially children, Sometimes they accidentally swallow the cap, it gets lodged in the <strong>windpipe</strong> and leads to death. It is estimated that roughly <strong>100</strong> people die in the US due to choking on pen lids. Telegraph has covered a <a title="Boy choked to death on his pen top" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1539833/Boy-choked-to-death-on-his-pen-top.html">news</a> based on the scenario, in which a nine-year-old boy died by swallowing the pen cap. </p>
<p>The pen caps have holes in them to prevent suffocation when they are accidentally swallowed. The pen company<a title="BIC" href="https://www.bicworld.com/en"><strong> BIC</strong></a> came out with an idea by just adding a large hole in the pen cap. So that the victim will be still able to <strong>breathe</strong>. This simple design will eventually save the lives. Hope you don't have this habit of swallowing.</p>
