<p>The urge for new discovering in the additive manufacturing field brought another technology from future, called as <a title="wikipedia- 4D printing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_printing">4D Printing</a></p>
<p>Almost 30 years, <strong>3D printing</strong> is still evolving with discovering new materials, printers, and application. Mit and Stratasys discovered the breakthrough technology in <strong>Self-assembly lab</strong> at <a title="Self assembly lab" href="https://selfassemblylab.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. This blog investigates the potential growth of 4D printing and its future application.</p>

<h3><strong>What is 4D printing?</strong></h3>
<p><a title="Stratasys" href="http://www.stratasys.com/">Stratasys</a>&nbsp;named it as <strong>connex multi-material 3d printing technology</strong>, which transforms 3d printed material over another structure when get stimulated by external sources like temperature, light or water. Mostly water will be used as activation energy for the pre-programmed 3d printed component.</p>

<p>The main concept of the project is to combine technologies to develop a programmable material which can <strong>reimagine and construct</strong> the shape after activating it like shape memory material.</p>
<h3><strong>So, Actually How it works?</strong></h3>
<p>It's self-assembly process. The connex multi-material technology leads the programmer to program various materials to transform its shape when subjected to activation resource with harnessing <a href="https://selfassemblylab.mit.edu/liquid-printed-products/">Water-absorbing&nbsp;</a>different properties which activates the self-assembly process.</p>
<p>In the below video water activates the flat shaped material, which reforms from the initial shape to programmed shape. This transforming functionality video was a demonstration in MIT self-assembly lab.</p>

<h3><strong>How it differs from 3d printing</strong></h3>
<p>4D printing is like augmenting the 3d printed component. In <a title="3D_printing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D_printing</a>, the materials like Absor pla&nbsp;will be loaded in the 3d printer and a static structure will be printed in that printer, which can&rsquo;t be transformed from its rigid structure. There are various kind of <a title="3D Printing technologies" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing_processes">3D Printing technologies</a> materials and <a title="Printers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_printer_manufacturers">Printers.</a></p>

<p>In 4d printing <a title="Special material" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127713-4d-printing-makes-objects-that-assemble-themselves-when-heated/">Special material&nbsp;</a>like hydrogel or shape memory material, termed as the smart material will be loaded in a multi-material 3d printer which design consists of inverse problem modeling will be printed as a <strong>static structure</strong>. When stimulated the mechanism of iteration takes place and the dynamic intelligent structure will be generated.</p>

<h3><strong>Unique feature</strong></h3>
<p>Finding become technology with its unique feature, which lays an advantage over other technology. One <a title="Unique feature" href="http://www.printerworkswest.com/blog/100-discover-the-advantages-of-4d-printing.html">Unique feature </a>of 4d printing is the size reduction factor. Huge objects can be folded before shipping and then expanded to its desired shape. Huge volume object can be printed in small-sized printer since it can be shrink and folded. In the below photo the volume reduced to<strong> 85% from actual size</strong>.</p>

<p>Apart from these, there are various potential advantages of 4d printing with the usage of possible applied materials. It's going to revolutionize the world of material which we are using now and which we haven't discovered. Check out the video from MIT self-assembly lab, where the material remembers its shape.</p>

<h3><strong>Where it will be used</strong></h3>
<p>Imagination extends beyond the sky. As like parent 3d printing, the child will also tend its application in various fields. One such in the 
<a title="Medical field" href="https://www.dr-hempel-network.com/digital-health-technolgy/4d-printing-in-health-care/">Medical field</a> where a drug delivery device designed to work with body temperature, that release medicine only at the sign of fever.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">“While it pegs the technology's cumulative annual growth rate at over 33.2% from 2020 to 2025, it sizes the total market at $313.1 million by the end of that period,”

<p>Think about furniture, the only drawback of the 3d printed furniture is the size doesn&rsquo;t suit in all printer, what if we print a foldable piece of furniture. It can be used in space-related appliances where size matters a lot.</p>
