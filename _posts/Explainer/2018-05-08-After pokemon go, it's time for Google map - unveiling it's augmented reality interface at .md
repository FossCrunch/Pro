<p><span class="first-letter">T</span>ech giant Google announces its new <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> based maps for navigation in <a href="https://events.google.com/io/" target="_blank">Google I/O 2018</a>. Though announcement date is not confirmed, this going to be future of Google map with <a title="Augmented reality -wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank">augmented reality</a> platform. This<strong> killer new experience</strong> tends to be the best way to <strong>avoid backtrack</strong> or slow updating issues.</p>

<p>Getting rid of backtrack issue or finding out which shop is best always increases the level of stress. Enquiring with our friend and then finding the suggestions will be <strong>annoying</strong>. Google introduced some <strong>new ways</strong> to solve this.</p>

<h3><b>Augmented Map Experience</b></h3>
<p>Google uses our <strong>camera for live feed</strong> combining with the <a href="https://www.google.com/streetview/" target="_blank">street view</a> data and <a href="https://www.google.co.in/maps" target="_blank">Google map</a> data for <strong>overlaying</strong> the 3d tiles on top of the <strong>real world</strong> making us convenient to find out the way we required.</p>

<p>It's time for us to follow a <strong>navigate assistance</strong> such as fox ( showed off at Google I/O) after following pokemon in the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/app/pokemon-go/" target="_blank">pokemon go game</a>. The navigate assist will guide us to the destination, making more comfortable than following a blue dot hence <strong>avoid backtrack issues</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-fitzpatrick-b723182" target="_blank">Jen Fitzpatrick</a> VP of Google&rsquo;s engineering and product management said Google maps was working to give users better recommendations for <strong>local place</strong>.</p>

<h3><b>"For you"- Tab It&rsquo;s for you</b></h3>

<p>The For You tab will feature recommendations specifically for you. It <strong>keeps track</strong> of your favorite location and even your friend's favorite location which will be considered for voting during a group trip. For this Google created a " <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/android-intents" target="_blank"><strong>Match Number</strong></a> " system to generate a personal score which keeps your past experiences also.</p>
